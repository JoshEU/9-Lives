# 9 Lives #  

## About: ##  
9 Lives is a **Co-operative, 2D Shooter Platformer** consisting of a **Life Cat** and a **Death Cat**. Both of which are **trapped** on the **wrong side** and must fight through **9 gruelling and menacing waves** in order to **make it back to their respective sides**.  
**For clarity**: **The Life Cat** is **trapped** on the **Death Side** (located on the **RIGHT SIDE of the Screen**) and the **Death Cat** is **trapped** on the **Life Side** (located on the **LEFT SIDE of the Screen**).   
This game has a **unique aspect** unlike any other in the genre, both players **can only damage enemies on the other side of the portal** (located in the **MIDDLE of the Screen**).   
However, **enemies** on **your side** are **immune to any damage you inflict upon them** but can **still damage you**.   
So watch out and make sure to **communicate with your team-mate** as you both **traverse the 9 waves** and face off against the treacherous **Overworld** and **Underworld Enemies** that will **show you no mercy**!  
So what are you waiting for?   
Grab a **Friend** or a **Family Member** or even your **favourite Pet Cat** and **Play 9Lives Now** to see if you both have what it takes to **triumph** the **brutal 9 Waves that lie ahead**.
